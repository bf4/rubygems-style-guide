# The RubyGems Development Style Guide

So, you're writing a RubyGem. Wouldn't it be great if there were a place
you could reference which contains all the shared wisdom and experience
of gem authors and maintainers?  Well, here you are.

# What is this?

A set of community-driven set of best practices, conventions, and gotchas
for gem authors and maintainers. It is meant to augment and supplement the
[RubyGems Guides](http://guides.rubygems.org/), and perhaps serve as a
sounding-board for ideas before they go into the Guide.

Inspired by [Bozhidar's Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)

Translations of the guide are available in the following languages:
